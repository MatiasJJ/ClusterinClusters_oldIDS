# Clusterin'Clusters

Welcome to use `Clusterin'Clusters` -code!

We assume you have just created a plethora of .xyz- and .log-files and your face looks like

Or actually we assume that you hae created a shitload of XTB-data and still your face looks like:
```
  L...L

  ```

> Don't worry, we have kind of solved the problem for you.

## The purpose of this code package is

*Reduce the amount of molecules for the next level of theory computations*

### First

Choose your weapon:  

| *Features*          | **Jupyter**     | **Script-collection**   |
| :------------------ | :-------------- | :-------------- |
| Looks               | Nice            | Boring          |
| Printed information | Plots           | some info text  |
| Nerd-index          | Big             | Low             |
| Requirements | [Jupyter](https://anaconda.org) | [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org) |
| Recommended for     | Scientists  | Chemists    |

***
Integrate the scripts into the python stuff
***

*Both make use of `CollectAndSortFiles.sh` and `DataExtractor.sh` which are Bash-scripts that organize the data into the form that can be then analyzed by the script*  

### Second

Download your weapon of choice:

##### Jupyter Notebook

Files:  
`ClusterClusterML.ipynb`  
`JupyterNotebook`-folder

Put them into the folder where your data is
> Or how the `.sh`'s make it work?

##### The Script collection

Files:  
`Scripts`-folder

Put them into the folder where your data is
> Or how the `.sh`'s make it work?

### Third

Run
```
            _( }
   -=  _  <<  \
      `.\__/`/\\
