### First

Choose your weapon:  

| *Features*          | **Jupyter**     | **Script-collection**   |
| :------------------ | :-------------- | :-------------- |
| Looks               | EyeCandy        | Plain           |
| Printed information | Plots           | "Done"          |
| Nerd-index          | Big             | Fair            |
| Requirements | [Jupyter](https://anaconda.org) | [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org) |

*Both make use of `CollectAndSortFiles.sh` and `DataExtractor.sh` which are Bash-scripts that organize the data into the form that can be then analyzed by the script*  

### Second

Download your weapon of choice:

##### Jupyter Notebook

Files:  
`ClusterClusterML.ipynb`  
`Scripts`-folder

Put them into the folder where your data is
> Or how the `.sh`'s make it work?

##### The Script collection

Files:  
`Scripts`-folder

Put them into the folder where your data is
